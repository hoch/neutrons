A web audio / midi prototyping playground

`Chrome only`

Includes
* Many audio dsp related conversion functions and mappings (Lin, Exp, dB)
* Many music related conversion functions (musical time vs. absolute time)
* Sequencer for midi and waa-modules, grooves, arpeggio
* Promise based loading and decoding audio samples 
* Simplified parameters, worklet-sharing and graphical elements for prototyping
* Simplified midi-access, midi-through, midi-message creation
* Euclidean pattern creation
* Simple waveform / spectrum viewer
* Ready to use effect-chains (echo, stereo-delay with filter)
* Many examples (fully-fletched pad-synth, emulated guitar, kick-factory, ...)
* All slides of my presentation at [Reasons.to 2018](https://reasons.to/2018/brighton/speakers/andre-michelle)
