* Many music related conversion functions (musical time vs. absolute time)
* Sequencer for midi and waa-modules + grooves & arpeggio
* Promise based loading and decoding audio samples 
* Simplified parameters, worklet-sharing and graphical editors for prototyping
* Simplified midi-access, decoding/encoding midi-messages
